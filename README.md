## Hi, I'm Sean Huvaya 👋

I'm a **Data Engineer** with a solid backend engineering foundation and growing expertise in **machine learning operations (MLOps)**.  

I've worked across international teams on financial platforms and humanitarian programs — optimizing SQL queries, automating data pipelines, refactoring legacy systems, deploying Dockerized apps on AWS, and integrating ML features into real-time workflows.  

Recently completed my **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** from Yeshiva University (Dec 2025), with coursework in Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Data Science, and Cloud Computing.
