## Hi, I'm Sean Huvaya 👋

I'm a **Data Engineer** with a solid backend engineering foundation and growing expertise in **machine learning operations (MLOps)**.  

I've worked across international teams optimizing SQL queries, automating data pipelines, refactoring legacy systems, deploying Dockerized apps on AWS, and integrating ML features into real-time workflows.  

Recently completed my **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** from Yeshiva University (Dec 2025), with coursework in Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Data Science, and Cloud Computing.

🔭 I’m currently working on **real-time data streaming** by exploring the **NYC 311 Service Requests dataset** — one of the largest open civic datasets in the world.

My goal is to build a robust streaming pipeline using **Apache Kafka** to ingest, process, and analyze complaints/requests in near real-time. This project is helping me master event-driven architectures, data ingestion at scale, and fault-tolerant streaming — key skills for production data engineering and MLOps.
